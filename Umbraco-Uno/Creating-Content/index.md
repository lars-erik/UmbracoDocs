# Creating content

When you are creating content in Umbraco Uno, you will have many tools at your disposal. This page is designed to help you get started on utilizing these tools.

## Choosing the correct tools

When you want to create content, it is a good idea to think about what tools to use for the job.

An example of this could be choosing between the Image widget and the Gallery widget. The Image widget only allows you to add one image, whereas the Gallery widget will allow you to set up a gallery of images and you can also choose to only select one image with that widget

Which of these two widgets you choose to use for the job depends on what you specifically need for this situation.

There is multiple ways to approach content creation, two of these ways are explained. Both approaches use the [Grid](../Widgets/Grid) feature.

### Widget based design and structure

If you do not have a predefined design you want to follow, coming up with a design and a structure based on the possibilities of widgets is a great way to start.

The grid widget gives you all the tools you would need to create a good looking website. All of these widgets are great to work with. Making a grid is a good way to secure a good structure, and these grids can be saved in global content to keep the same look and feel throughout you website pages.

### Fitting widgets to your already existing design and structure

If you already have a predefined design you need to achieve, the grid widget is a good option.

To get started it would be a good choice, to start by setting up the grid structure in a global content page. Doing so will allow you to keep a consistent structure throughout your pages.
Keeping the grid in a global content page is both time efficient and structure efficient as you will only have to set up the core structure once.

## [Working With Content](Work-With-content/index.md)

## [Rich Text Editor](Rich-Text-Editors/index.md)

The Rich Text Editor or RTE as people call it is a great way to create content. It is a text editor, that allows you to write longer text pieces with all the formatting options you would need.

## [Working With Widgets](Working-With-Widgets/index.md)
