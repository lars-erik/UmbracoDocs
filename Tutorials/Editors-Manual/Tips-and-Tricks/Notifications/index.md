# Notifications

You can set up notifications so any user can receive an email when an action is performed on a given content item. You will need to have your email address added to your user profile for the notifications to be sent to you.

1. Right click the page you wish to be notified about. Alternatively when on the selected page click the ***Actions*** button in the top right of the admin screen.
2. Choose **notifications** from the context menu.
3. Check the boxes which you are interested in and you will receive notifications each time the given action occurs.

:::note
The notification settings apply to the chosen content item as well as any child items that appear below the item in the content tree.

:::note
If the notifications option does not appear, the SMTP settings are probably incorrect. In this case please contact the administrator of your website.
